# Email Troubleshooting Guide

## Why Am I Not Receiving Confirmation Emails?

If you're not receiving confirmation emails from Student Market, here are the most common causes and solutions:

## 🔍 **Immediate Steps to Try:**

### 1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**
- Look in your spam/junk folder first
- Search for emails from "noreply@supabase.co" or "noreply@studentmarket.com"
- Mark the email as "Not Spam" if found

### 2. **Verify Email Address**
- Double-check you entered the correct email address
- Ensure there are no typos or extra spaces
- Make sure you're using your .edu email address

### 3. **Wait for Delivery**
- Emails can take 5-15 minutes to arrive
- Don't immediately try to resend

## 🚫 **Common Email Provider Issues:**

### **University/College (.edu) Emails:**
- Many universities have strict email filtering
- IT departments often block external services
- Some .edu domains reject emails from new senders

### **Gmail:**
- Check "Promotions" and "Updates" tabs
- Look in "All Mail" folder
- Check if emails are being filtered

### **Outlook/Hotmail:**
- Check "Junk Email" folder
- Look in "Other" or "Focused" inbox
- Check spam filter settings

### **Yahoo Mail:**
- Check "Spam" folder
- Look in "Bulk" folder
- Check filter settings

## 🛠️ **Solutions to Try:**

### **Solution 1: Resend Confirmation Email**
- Use the "Resend Confirmation Email" button on the signup page
- Wait a few minutes between attempts
- Don't spam the resend button

### **Solution 2: Use Alternative Email**
- Try using a personal Gmail account temporarily
- You can change your email later in your profile
- Some users have success with Gmail vs .edu addresses

### **Solution 3: Check Email Settings**
- Add "noreply@supabase.co" to your contacts
- Check your email provider's spam filter settings
- Look for any email rules that might be blocking messages

### **Solution 4: Contact Support**
- If nothing works, contact your university IT department
- Ask if they block emails from Supabase or external services
- Request them to whitelist our email domain

## 📧 **Email Provider-Specific Instructions:**

### **Gmail:**
1. Go to Gmail Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses
2. Create a filter for "noreply@supabase.co"
3. Mark it as "Never send it to Spam"
4. Apply the filter

### **Outlook:**
1. Right-click on any Supabase email
2. Select "Junk" → "Not Junk"
3. Check "Don't move messages from this sender to Junk"

### **Yahoo Mail:**

## 🔧 **Technical Solutions:**

### **Check DNS Records:**

- Ensure your domain has proper SPF/DKIM records
- This is usually handled by your email provider

### **Firewall/Network Issues:**
- University networks often block certain services
- Try from a different network (mobile data, home WiFi)
- Check if your network blocks port 587 (SMTP)

## 📱 **Mobile Email Apps:**
- Check if you're using the official email app
- Some third-party email apps have different filtering
- Try checking email on a computer browser

## ⏰ **Timing Issues:**
- Don't sign up multiple times quickly
- Wait at least 5 minutes between attempts
- Emails are sent in batches, not instantly

## 🆘 **Still Having Issues?**

If none of the above solutions work:

1. **Contact Your University IT:**

   - Request whitelisting of our domain
   - Check if they block external authentication services
